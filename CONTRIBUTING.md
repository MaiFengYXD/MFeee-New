## Code Style

### Naming Conventions

Please strive to use **PascalCase** for naming new code elements. This applies broadly to types, their members, and other general identifiers, including non-special constants and variables, to promote consistent readability.

### Formatting

**Align Assignments**: For improved readability and visual consistency, we **recommend** vertically aligning assignment operators (`=`) within blocks of related declarations or definitions, such as object literals, table definitions, or consecutive variable assignments.
