## 🛠️Build:
To begin, **clone** this repository or **download** and extract **[main.zip](https://github.com/MaiFengYXD/MFeee-New/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)**.

Then, you can directly execute **[Build.bat](./Build.bat)** (for Windows) or **[Build.sh](./Build.sh)** (for macOS and Linux) to build the script. You can also follow the steps below to **build manually**:

1. Download and extract **[Rokit](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rokit/releases)** appropriate for your OS
2. Navigate to the **extracted folder** and run:
    ```
    rokit self-install
    ```
3. Install tools:
    ```
    rokit trust rojo-rbx/rojo
    rokit trust seaofvoices/darklua
    rokit trust lune-org/lune

    rokit add rojo-rbx/rojo@7.5.1
    rokit add seaofvoices/darklua@0.16.0
    rokit add lune-org/lune@0.8.9

    rokit list
    ```
4. Go to the **repository folder** you just **cloned** (or **downloaded**). Then, run:
    ```
